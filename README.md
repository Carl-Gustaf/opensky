# Simplified Prototype: Distributed Resource Network (DRN)


## Core Components for POC

### 1. Atomic Units Implementation
- **Storage**: Simple encrypted file chunks with redundancy (3x replication)
- **Compute**: Docker container execution with verifiable inputs/outputs
- **Networking**: Basic bandwidth sharing for data transfer with bandwidth accounting

### 2. Orchestration Layer (Simplified)
- Central coordinator for the POC (decentralize in later versions)
- Job definition format that specifies resource requirements
- Basic task scheduler that matches resources to requirements
- Simple verification system for resource utilization

### 3. Marketplace Mechanics
- Token-based compensation system
- Dynamic pricing based on resource availability
- Reputation system for reliable providers

## POC Execution: "Run Once Job" Flow

1. **Resource Registration**:
   - Providers run client software that reports available resources
   - Resources are classified by capability (storage space, CPU cores, memory, bandwidth)

2. **Job Submission**:
   - User defines job requirements in a simple JSON format
   - Uploads input data to storage layer

3. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Orchestrator identifies suitable providers based on requirements and availability
   - Negotiates resource pricing based on current market conditions

4. **Task Execution**:
   - Input data is transferred to compute nodes
   - Docker containers run the specified workload
   - Results are stored back in the storage layer

5. **Result Delivery**:
   - Final output is delivered to the user
   - Providers are compensated automatically

## Technical Implementation Options

### For Quick Implementation:
- **Backend**: Node.js or Python for orchestration server
- **Container Tech**: Docker for isolation and portability
- **Communication**: WebRTC for peer connections and gRPC for service definitions
- **Storage**: Content-addressed storage inspired by IPFS
- **Verification**: Simple proof-of-work for compute tasks
- **Marketplace**: Simple token ledger with basic pricing algorithms

## Key Metrics to Validate

1. **Technical Feasibility**: Can resources be effectively shared and utilized?
2. **Performance Overhead**: How much latency does the distributed approach add?
3. **Economic Viability**: Are incentives sufficient to attract and retain providers?
4. **Security Model**: Does basic isolation protect both providers and users?

## Potential First Use Cases

1. **Batch Data Processing**: ETL jobs that aren't time-sensitive
2. **Distributed Rendering**: Frame rendering for 3D animations
3. **Content Distribution**: Decentralized file sharing with incentives
4. **Machine Learning Training**: Distributed model training for non-sensitive data
